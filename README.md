# Clide - A Modern Terminal IDE

Clide is a terminal-native IDE built with Rust, inspired by the principles and interface of modern editors like Visual Studio Code. It aims to provide a fast, efficient, and highly extensible development environment that lives entirely within your terminal, with a special focus on integration with AI agents.

## üñ•Ô∏è Layout

Clide is designed with a familiar three-panel layout:

```
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

|      File Tree       |   Editor / Terminal  |      AI Agent        |
|      (Left)        |       (Center)       |       (Right)        |
|                      |                      |                      |
|                      |                      |                      |
